We get given two files, `ciphertext.txt`, and the script used to make it, `encrypt.py`. Looking through `encrypt.py` it's a pretty simple substitution cipher, with one major flaw - it only encrypts lowercase characters. Because the ciphertext is mostly uppercase or numbers I just guessed a likely flag. This was actually the first challenge I worked on, but because I didn't check the other ones I had no idea what the flag's prefix should be, so I put this one on hold until I'd solved Invitation, and then I could get the rest of the flag.
