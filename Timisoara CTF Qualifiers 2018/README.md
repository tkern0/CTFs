Timisoara CTF Qualifiers 2018
---

This was the first CTF I did, after coming across LiveOverflow on youtube and binging all his videos. I did it alone and ended up scoring 1091 points, coming 62nd overall, which I'm pretty happy with for doing alone and for being my first one ever. The leaderboards were actually split into two groups, eligible teams and ones doing it just for fun, I was part of the latter where I came 46th.

Note that the python scripts are sporadically written in either version,  I just used what was easiest at the time. For challenges where I used both I tried to indicate what uses what.
