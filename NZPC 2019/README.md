NZ Programming Contest 2019
---

This was the second time I participated in the NZPC, unfortunately I lost my files the first time. I competed solo in the Tertiary Intermediate category where I came 3rd with 52 points. I solved all 3-point and 10-point problems, 5 of which I was the first to solve. The two groups that beat me both solved 100 point problems unfortunately, which gave me no shot at a better placing.

I think most of the code is relatively self explanatory, there aren't many other ways to do things, so not all of the files have comments. I wasn't going to waste time writing comments during the event, so the comments that do exist are all my thoughts from afterwards.

Problem N in particular has an extensive description.
